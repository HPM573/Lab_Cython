# Lab: Cython

1. Make sure Cython is installed (see [here](/Notes/CythonForWindows.md) for Windows)
2. Cythonize the [simulation model](/Cy) by runing the `Setup.py` with parameters `build_ext --inplace`.
3. Run [`RunSim.py`](/ComparePyCy.py) to compare the performance of the models built in python and cython.
